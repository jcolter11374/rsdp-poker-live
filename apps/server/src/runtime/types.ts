 * another version is not loaded at all (loadTable in storage.ts returns null). After a bump, every saved cash table
 * would be "not found", its players unable to get back to it or cash out, and every running tournament table would
 * start again from the director's seats, losing its hand in play, its old snapshot overwritten at the next save.
 *
 * Keep old snapshots readable instead: add fields as optional ("missing in older snapshots") and fill them in when a
 * table loads or resumes (as getTable in app.ts does for realGame, and giveBotsLooks in table.ts for bot looks). Only
 * a change old snapshots can't be read under at all needs a bump, and then loadTable must convert the old version first.
