          changed server can&rsquo;t also change what they found. What they can&rsquo;t catch is on <a href="/fairness">Fair dealing</a>, under &ldquo;How the developer could cheat you&rdquo;.

            {version && <>, started {when(version.startedAt)}</>}. That is the server describing itself, so on its own it proves nothing.
          </li>
          <li>
            GitHub&rsquo;s watcher asks Fly which image the live machine runs, and checks GitHub&rsquo;s own signed record of how that image was built. It also
            checks the machine&rsquo;s start command, settings and secret names, which could otherwise make the same image run other code. It runs right after every
            release, and on a schedule set to every hour, though GitHub often starts scheduled jobs hours late, so in practice it checks every few hours.{' '}

          Every hand, every change to a player&rsquo;s buy-ins and cash-outs, every admin action that changes something and every server start goes into a chain where each entry includes a fingerprint of the one
          before. Editing or removing an old entry breaks every fingerprint after it. The record holds no names and no table links.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The site&rsquo;s record has {head ? `${head.seq.toLocaleString()} entries` : '…'}.</li>
          <li>
            GitHub&rsquo;s watcher copies it each time it runs (every few hours):{' '}
            {copy === null ? '…' : copy === 'none' ? 'no copy yet.' : `up to entry ${copy.seq.toLocaleString()}, copied ${copy.copied ? when(copy.copied) : ''}.`}{' '}

          </li>
          <li>
            Your browser remembers the latest entry it saw, and checks on every visit that the record still has it, unchanged{problem ? '' : ': so far, it does'}.
          </li>
          <li>&ldquo;Check this hand&rdquo; checks a revealed hand against the record, and the ledger checks every buy-in and cash-out.</li>
        </ul>

          The site&rsquo;s record can be wrong about itself, so GitHub&rsquo;s copy is the one to trust. A restart is normal after a release, or when Fly moves the machine. Admin actions are things like removing a test table. A shell on the server (which John can open) is not
          recorded anywhere: Fly doesn&rsquo;t offer a way to show that publicly.
