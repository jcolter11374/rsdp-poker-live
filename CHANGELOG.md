# Changelog

Every release of RSDP Live!, newest first.

<!-- Made by `npm run changelog` from apps/web/src/roadmap/changelog.json and whatsnew.json. Edit those, not this file. -->
This file is made from [`changelog.json`](apps/web/src/roadmap/changelog.json) and
[`whatsnew.json`](apps/web/src/roadmap/whatsnew.json), the same data as the site's
[Changelog](https://rsdp-poker-live.fly.dev/changelog) and [What's new](https://rsdp-poker-live.fly.dev/whats-new) pages, so they can't
say different things. Don't edit it by hand: change the JSON and run `npm run changelog`.
The layout follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Versions are dates ([calendar versioning](https://calver.org/)): `2026.11.01` is the first
release on 1 November 2026 and `2026.11.01.2` the second that day. Each version has a git
tag (`v2026.11.01`) and a [GitHub release](https://github.com/jcolter11374/rsdp-poker-live/releases) that also lists the issues it
closed. Releases before 1 November 2026 weren't tagged, so they are listed by date.

On `main`, every entry here is live. On `develop`, the top entry may be the next release,
still being filled in: its tag and GitHub release only exist once it goes live. Work that is
merged but not live yet is also on the issues labelled [status: on develop](https://github.com/jcolter11374/rsdp-poker-live/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22status%3A+on+develop%22).

## [2026.11.07.7] - 2026-11-07

_Phone alerts, and a table for screen readers and the keyboard_

### New

- **Phone alerts, even with the site closed.** Turn on alerts with the Alerts button on the tournaments page or in a tournament's lobby. Your phone or computer then tells you when a tournament you're in starts in 5 minutes, when you're seated or moved to another table, and when it's your turn, or your pick at a Dealer's choice table. This works even when the site isn't open. "Your turn" only comes when you aren't already looking at that table, and you get one alert per turn, not two. On iPhone and iPad, alerts work once the site is on your home screen (Safari: Share, then Add to Home Screen); the button says how. An alert holds only its words and the page to open, never cards or amounts. Turning alerts off, signing out or deleting your account makes the site forget that browser straight away. The privacy page says what is kept and who delivers the alerts.
- **Works with a screen reader and the keyboard.** The table now reads itself aloud to screen readers: each new line of the hand, "Your turn" with what you can do and the pot, pauses, and a warning when 10 seconds are left. Tab reaches every nameplate, which says who is to act, who has folded and who has the button, and Enter opens that player's menu. Dialogs and phone sheets keep the keyboard inside them and hand it back when they close. And the table's words and buttons are easier to read, with bigger buttons to tap.

### Fixed and changed

- Coach tips are now worked out on a thread of their own, so asking for lots of tips never slows down play at any table. Tips in draw games always think through every possible draw. If the coach is busy, it tells you to try again in a moment, and that doesn't count against your tips.
- Tournament tables no longer show numbered empty seats. Nobody picks a seat at a tournament, so the players now spread evenly round the table, with yours at the bottom, and their nameplates get the room the empty seats took. If you're knocked out, the table stays turned your way until the next hand. Cash tables keep their empty seats for sitting down and adding bots.
- Keyboard: Shift+A twice goes all in on your turn in no-limit and pot-limit hands. The first press puts the most you can bet in the box and says on the action bar what the second press will send: in pot limit that's the most the pot allows. Enter sends it too, and Esc, a click or any other key cancels it. A still ticks Call any before your turn, and Shift+A does nothing in fixed-limit games.
- Seven Card Stud, Stud Hi-Lo and Razz: when everyone is all in before the last card, the rest of the hand is now dealt a street at a time, like an all-in in hold'em. Before, every card and the result appeared at once. This works the same in HORSE and the other mixed games.
- All-in runouts: only the last card turns over now, and only once. Before, the flop turned over again when the turn landed, and the turn again when the river landed. The hand replayer works the same way.
- The table is easier to read. The green buttons (Raise, Start game, Sit down, Invite) now use the darker green the rest of the site uses, the red host tag, request counts and Fold anyway? are darker, and the empty seats' Sit and + Bot are brighter. The words in the middle of the felt (Next hand in, Paused, the game's name, Run 1, the side-pot total) sit on a dark backing. + Bot, the quick chat replies and the Straddle and Wait for the big blind switches are bigger and easier to tap.
- Tournaments: after a hand that knocks someone out, the top bar's level and the countdown to the next game keep going, instead of stopping until the next hand, or for good when that hand was the table's last.
- Tournaments: a player knocked out in a table's last hand, who stayed looking at it after the table broke, no longer sees "Next hand in 0" there for good.
- Stud games' log names each street before its cards (Fourth Street, then who gets what), instead of after them.
- Each table and tournament lobby now names itself in the browser tab's title, so with a few tables open you can tell the tabs apart.
- Dealer's choice at a table where the host approves new players: a seat offered from the waitlist to someone the host hasn't approved yet no longer stops a smaller game from being picked. Like a seat request, taking it asks the host for the seat, and the request waits until the game has room. When a waitlist offer has to be let go (the table gets smaller, or a smaller game has no room for it), its holder keeps their place: the seats are offered again in queue order, so nobody behind them sits first.

## [2026.11.07.6] - 2026-11-07

_Bigger tournament tables on wide screens_

### New

- **The tournament clock moves to the corner.** On a computer screen 1440 pixels wide or more, a tournament table's level, clock, blinds and players left now sit in a box in the bottom-right corner, across from the chat, so the table gets the room above it. On a wide but short screen that makes the seats and cards as big as at a cash table. Anything that needs you, like a rebuy offer, an add-on or your seat at another table, shows under the table with your buttons, so the seats don't move when it comes or goes. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- Mixed games (HORSE, 8-Game, any rotation of games, mixed tournaments) and Dealer's choice on a computer: the seats no longer move when the game changes. The table is laid out for every game it deals, so the felt keeps its size and the seats keep their places from one game to the next. At a busy table in a small window, where every game's cards can't fit at once, the seats are spaced for the game being played and still shift when the game changes.
- On a computer, the seats also stay put when the space under the table or the top bar changes height by a few pixels in the middle of a hand.
- Wide, short screens and laptops: when a hand ends with several winners (a split pot or side pots), or is run twice, the middle of the table no longer runs onto the players above and below it. Several winners' lines sit side by side where there's room, and where the middle still doesn't fit it's drawn a little smaller. The seats don't move for it.
- Computers: the top bar's line (the table's name, the game, the stakes and so on) now stays on one line. On smaller windows a long line used to wrap, which made the bar taller and the table smaller, and the table could shrink in the middle of a hand when something new appeared in the bar (the Pick next game button at a Dealer's choice table, Paused, or a blind level's clock). When the line doesn't fit, the table's name is shortened with "…" first; point at the line to see all of it.
- Bomb pots at HORSE, 8-Game and stud tables: a Hold'em bomb pot dealt in place of a stud hand no longer shows the stud ante in the top bar, the hand history or hand search. Nobody posts that ante in a bomb pot. At a stud-only table it also shows Hold'em blinds, such as 0.25/0.50 rather than 0/0.50.
- Tournament lobbies: the selected tab keeps its white look when the mouse is over it, or after a tap on a phone, instead of turning to dark text on dark grey.
- Host controls: a seat request now reads on one line, with Approve, the seat list and Reject under it. Before, the words were squeezed to one per line and the seat list was cut off.
- The keyboard tip no longer covers a seat or your own cards. On a laptop it sits at the top of the side column, and on a big screen in the bottom-right corner, across from the chat, or at the top of the Log panel (Host & log for hosts) while that is open. At a tournament table, where the tournament clock has that corner, it stays at the top of the Log panel. A narrower window doesn't show it; the action buttons still show their keys.
- One of something now reads in the singular: "1 hand" instead of "1 hands" in the top bar when a level of blinds has one hand left, in the Dealer's choice picker and atop a downloaded hand history, and "1 minute" when a table set to 1 minute turns away a player who left and came back with fewer chips, or releases an offline seat.
- Laptops and other smaller windows: at a busy table, the seats no longer shift when a hand ends and the players' hands are named under their names ("Full House, Queens full of Sevens"). The seats are spaced for the longest hand name from the deal, and in hi-lo games for both halves.
- Dealer's choice: a game the host is taking off the menu during a hand is now greyed out in the game picker, with "The host is taking it off the menu" under it, and Keep playing isn't offered for it. Before, the picker still offered it, and tapping it only brought an error.
- Dealer's choice: when the host changes the menu during a hand, the pick panel's "If time runs out" line now names the game a missed pick really deals from the new menu. Before, a menu with the games in another order, or with a game added at the top, could make it name a different game from the one dealt.
- Waitlist: pressing Join the waitlist while an all-in is being dealt out no longer tells you whether someone busted. You're added to the waitlist either way, and a seat that comes free is offered once the cards are out. At a table that seats newcomers at random, a seat offered from the waitlist is a random one too. And if the host makes the table smaller during a hand and the seat you were offered is needed for a player moving in, you stay on the waitlist for the next seat instead of losing your place.
- Tournaments on a computer screen 1440 pixels wide or more: the level, clock, blinds and players left now sit in a box in the bottom-right corner, across from the chat, instead of a strip above the table. Anything for you to do (a rebuy, an add-on, a re-entry, your seat at another table) shows under the table with your buttons, so the seats don't move when it comes or goes.
- Tournaments on a wide but short screen (about 2300 by 800, an ultrawide monitor or a big screen with tall browser bars): the seats and cards are now as big as at a cash table, in every game. Before, the strip above the table took just enough height to drop every seat and card to its smallest size.
- Wide screens a little too short for the bigger table now get it a little smaller, instead of falling straight back to the smallest seats and cards. The cards in the middle of the table come out a little smaller than before, to fit.
- Stud, Razz and Stud Hi-Lo on a big screen: on third and fourth street the players at the left and right ends of the table no longer run off the edge of the window, and the seats along the top and bottom no longer overlap.

## [2026.11.07.5] - 2026-11-07

### Fixed and changed

- Spectators watching on a delay now see a change the host made during a hand, and a blind level counted in hands, move on with the hand they are shown, not the moment the live table deals its next hand. The "every card face up" note starts with its hand too.

## [2026.11.07.4] - 2026-11-07

_Lobby chat moderation and a recap of the night_

### New

- **Moderate a tournament's lobby chat.** Tournament hosts can now mute someone, delete a message for everyone, or turn the lobby chat off and back on. Co-hosts can too if the host gave them the power to move and remove players, which now also covers chat. A muted player, or everyone while the chat is off, is told why they can't send. Mute and Delete ask first, and on a phone the buttons sit under each message, big enough to tap. And you can hide someone's messages just for yourself, as at the tables: hiding someone in one place hides them in the other too.
- **Copy a recap of the night.** At cash games, the ledger has a new Copy recap button. It gives you a few lines about the night, ready to paste into the group chat: the date, the games played, how many hands and for how long, everyone's result from biggest winner down, and the biggest pot. The results are the same dollars-and-cents figures Settle up uses, and the recap never includes a link to the table or anyone's cards. You see it before you copy it, and if your phone won't let the site copy it, the text is selected so you can copy it yourself.

### Fixed and changed

- Table settings: switching a HORSE or 8-Game table, or a Dealer's choice table with stud games, to one game without stud now takes the stud ante off (and any blind-schedule level antes with it), so Hold'em hands no longer have an ante as well as the blinds. The same goes for changing a stud table's game to one without stud. Trying another way of choosing the game and coming back leaves the table's own ante, Limit bets and bring-in as they were, and stakes you type stay as you typed them however often you switch afterwards. With the blinds raised on a schedule, bringing in stud games now gives every level a stud ante for its own blinds, so the stud hands no longer play with only a bring-in when the levels had no ante. Opening Table settings again during the same hand now shows the change you saved, which waits for the next hand, and anything you change then is added to it.
- Dealer's choice: when the host switches the table to one game or to rotating games during a hand, the next chooser can no longer pick a game that would never be dealt. The Pick next game button and the PICK tag go, the top bar says it's the last hand, and if someone had already picked, the log says their pick isn't dealt. A game the host takes off the menu during a hand can no longer be picked, kept going or dealt when the clock runs out; if the host changes the whole menu, the chooser picks from the new one when the hand is over.
- Tournaments: when a table breaks right after a hand that knocked someone out, the players moved off it are taken to their new tables as soon as the hand's result shows, instead of sometimes staying on the old table until they reload.
- The Hands and Stats tabs no longer show a hand's result while its all-in runout is still being dealt on the table, if you open them for the first time just then.
- If you deleted your account, or played as a guest, you can ask John to take your name out of old games. It's replaced with "Deleted player" in hands, ledgers, table logs and chat, tournament entries and lobbies, and other players' shared hand links. Amounts and results stay exactly as they were. The privacy page says what this can't reach.
- The Checking John page now shows each time John takes a name out of old records, without the name itself.
- Tournaments: the seat draw stays secret even if the site ever has to go back to an older version before the seats are drawn. The server now picks new secret numbers for the draw each time it loads a tournament whose seats aren't drawn yet, so nothing an older version shows can be used to work the draw out.
- Backups: the nightly backup now works however big the saved tables get. Before, very large saved tables could make the backup fail and stop the site saving until it restarted. The site isn't near that size today.
- Dealer's choice: at a new table, the first hand's button goes to the player who makes the first pick, and if they leave or sit out first, to the next player round. During an all-in runout, the seat count, closed seats, the fallback game and seat offers now wait for the result like the PICK tag, so none of them shows who busted before the cards are out.

## [2026.11.07.3] - 2026-11-07

_Hands left in each game_

### New

- **See how many hands are left in each game.** At HORSE, 8-Game and any table that rotates games, the top bar now leads with the game being played, in bigger type, and says how many more hands of it there are and what comes next: "3 more hands, then Razz", then "Last hand, then Razz" (on a phone, "Razz after 3 more", then "Razz next hand"). When the new game starts, a banner on the table says so for a few seconds. Every tournament table's bar now leads with the game too, and a banner marks each new level; in mixed-game tournaments the bar also counts down to the next game ("Razz next, in 3:20"). (Suggested by John.)
- **The site has a shorter name.** The P in RSDP already stands for poker, so the site's name is now just RSDP Live! Only the name is new: the site looks the same and the web address hasn't changed. If you saved the site to your phone's home screen, it may keep the old name until you add it again. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- Cash tables, in the middle of a game: the seats no longer slide when someone asks to sit (for the host), when you sit out or come back, when a rebuy or a bot is waiting for the host, or when the host stops the game after the hand. Those notes now sit under the table with your buttons, in room that is already kept there. At a Limit table on a laptop, or with several notes at once, the table can still get a little smaller the first time, and then keeps that size. "Connection lost" now shows over the top of the table instead of pushing it down.

## [2026.11.07.2] - 2026-11-07

_Dealer's choice_

### New

- **Dealer's choice.** Players take turns choosing the game. Whoever has the gold PICK tag chooses the next game from a menu the host sets up, with How to play for every game on it, and the table plays it for one orbit. As soon as they pick, the tag moves one seat to the left, to whoever picks next. Pick Dealer's choice under Mixed games when you start a cash game, or in Table settings > Game. The menu starts with the 8-Game games; the host can fill it with the HORSE games, Hold'em and Omaha, or every game, and choose how long each pick lasts and how long the chooser has. Practice bots pick at random, so you get to try every game. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- Laptop-sized windows: at a busy table, nameplates no longer cover each other. In four-card Omaha, or with six or more players, the seats could run out of room and one player's nameplate sat on top of the next, hiding their stack. Seats now keep clear of each other, using the ends of the table when they need to, and stay put while the hand plays.
- Cash tables: the seats no longer slide across the table when the host starts the game. The note saying to press Start game, or that you're waiting for the host, is now in the middle of the table instead of in a bar above it, so the table keeps its size when the note goes.
- Tournaments with stud levels: the bring-in is now a round amount of about a third of the small bet, such as 600 at 2,000/4,000 instead of 666, and 1,000 at 4,000/8,000 instead of 1,333. A cash table whose bring-in is left at 0 works it out the same way.

## [2026.11.07] - 2026-11-07

### Fixed and changed

- Stud games with a big-blind ante (tournaments with stud levels, cash stud tables, and the stud games of HORSE and 8-Game): everyone now antes about an eighth of it (300 becomes 40 each, 0.50 becomes 0.06), instead of every player putting in the full amount. In tournaments the lobby clock and the structure table show the ante each level really deals, and the structure editor says how it works.
- Mixed games: a bomb pot dealt during a stud game no longer cuts the rest of that stud game short. It takes the place of one hand of the orbit, as it does in hold'em.
- Mixed games: making the table smaller in the middle of a game keeps that game's orbit going with the players who move to new seats, instead of counting by the old seat numbers, which could end the game early or make it run long.
- Mixed games: if a hand can't be dealt just as the game changes, the next game is no longer skipped when play carries on.
- Cash tables: a table no longer gets stuck when the blind rules would deal a hand to just one player (for example a new player in the small blind and a returning player on the button, with only three at the table). Everyone is dealt in free instead, as at the start of a game.
- Cash games with "Raise the blinds on a schedule": the Limit bets and the stud bring-in now rise with the blinds, instead of staying at the starting amounts. A level with no big blind (a stud schedule that only raises the antes) keeps them as they are.
- HORSE and 8-Game tables: before the first hand the top bar no longer shows an ante for a game that posts none (Limit Hold'em in HORSE, 2-7 Triple Draw in 8-Game).
- Hand search: Limit and No-Limit Hold'em are now separate choices in the Game list, and so is any other game you've played with more than one kind of betting.
- Hosts: a saved preset with more seats than one of its games deals (2-7 Triple Draw and Badugi deal at most 6) now starts a table with seats that fit, instead of a table that stops when it reaches that game.
- Run it twice after an all in on the flop or the turn: the second run now shows the cards both runs share as soon as the board splits, then deals its own cards one at a time, like the first run. Before, the shared cards landed together with the second run's first new card: its flop and turn at once after a flop all in, its whole board after a turn all in. The hand log also names the second run's turn and river now, instead of calling them "Board".
- Tournament seats are now drawn with a stronger random generator, the same kind used to shuffle the cards, from a secret seed each tournament gets of its own.
- Tournament lobbies: when the host changes a setting (late registration, re-entry, the table rules and so on), the Activity tab now says so and names the setting. A few changes made close together show as one line.
- Updates restart the server more cleanly: it no longer waits on a stuck browser connection before writing its last public record entries and closing the database. A rare case where a backup download cut off part-way could hold up table saves until the next restart is fixed too.
- Behind the scenes: John now gets an early warning if the server starts running short of memory or disk space, well before it could affect a game.

## [2026.11.06.5] - 2026-11-06

### Fixed and changed

- Wide but short screens: the table no longer twitches back and forth during a hand. A one-pixel rounding error, and the keyboard tip coming and going, kept flipping the table between two sizes.

## [2026.11.06.4] - 2026-11-06

_HORSE and 8-Game tournaments_

### New

- **HORSE and 8-Game tournaments.** When you host a tournament, tap HORSE or 8-Game next to Mixed under Game. The game changes every level, with Limit Hold'em and Omaha Hi-Lo played Limit, and 8-Game's No-Limit Hold'em and Pot-Limit Omaha levels as they should be. Seats per table drop to 8 for HORSE and 6 for 8-Game. The lobby and the tournament list show HORSE or 8-Game as the game. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- Mixed-game tournaments with stud in them: only the stud levels post the level's ante, as at cash tables. A tournament without stud games keeps its antes as before.
- Wide but short screens (an ultrawide monitor, or a big screen with tall browser bars): the bigger table and bigger cards now switch on there too, in every game. Before, a window like that fell back to the laptop layout and the seats and cards shrank, which looked tiny on the long table.

## [2026.11.06.3] - 2026-11-06

_HORSE and 8-Game_

### New

- **Play HORSE or 8-Game in one tap.** Pick HORSE or 8-Game under Mixed games when you start a cash game, or tap one in Table settings > Game. HORSE plays Limit Hold'em, Omaha Hi-Lo, Razz, Seven Card Stud and Stud Hi-Lo in turn; 8-Game adds 2-7 Triple Draw, No-Limit Hold'em and Pot-Limit Omaha. Each game lasts an orbit, and you can change the lengths or the games afterwards. How to play has a new Mixed games guide. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- Hosts: switching to a game with fewer seats (2-7 Triple Draw and Badugi seat 6, the stud games 8) no longer fails with "seat 8 is taken". If everyone fits, players in the seats that go move into free seats and the blinds carry on as normal. If not everyone fits, Table settings says how many players need to leave first. Lowering the seat count by hand works the same way.
- Mixed games with stud in them: only the stud games ante now, as in a card room. Hold'em, Omaha and draw hands in the same rotation are played on the blinds alone. A rotation without stud games keeps its antes as before.
- Mixed games: when a rotation went from a stud game back to hold'em or Omaha, the first blind game could end after a single hand instead of a full orbit. Every game now gets its full orbit.

## [2026.11.06.2] - 2026-11-06

### Fixed and changed

- Big screens: the bigger cards now show in every game, not just Hold'em and Omaha. Five- and six-card Omaha, Seven Card Stud, Razz, Stud Hi-Lo and 2-7 Triple Draw get the same bigger cards, with a little more room above the table so the top seats' cards stay clear of the top bar. Laptops and phones look as before.

## [2026.11.06] - 2026-11-06

### Fixed and changed

- The Roadmap page is up to date again: what it listed as coming next is already live, so it's been moved to Live now, along with the bigger table on big screens and the new all-in run-outs.

## [2026.11.05.7] - 2026-11-05

_A bigger table on big screens_

### New

- **The table fills your screen.** On a desktop monitor the table now grows into the space around it, and the seats, cards, chips and pot grow with it. It's the same felt, cards and sounds, just bigger. Chat sits in the bottom-left corner beside your buttons, and the log, ledger, hands and stats (and, for hosts, the host controls) slide out from the Log button in the top bar. Press Escape to close them again. (Suggested by Players at the 4 November game.)

### Fixed and changed

- Big screens: on a window 1440 pixels wide or more, the table now fills the screen. The table, seats, cards, chips and pot all grow to use the space that used to be dark, while the felt, colours, cards and sounds stay the same. Chat moves to a box in the bottom-left corner beside your action buttons, and the log, ledger, hands, stats and host controls open from the new Log button (Host & log for hosts) in the top bar. Laptops and phones look as before.

## [2026.11.05.6] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed and changed

- On a computer: after you send a chat message, the cursor now leaves the chat box, so the keys you press next go to the game again (F, K, C, R, or a bet amount) instead of into chat. Press Enter to chat again. Clicking a quick reply (gg, nh...) lets go too.
- On a computer: on your turn, typing a number starts your bet amount in the bet box, then Enter bets it. No need to click the box first.
- Hosts on a computer: pressing Enter after clicking Start game or Pause no longer presses that button again (Start game turns into Stop game, so it asked whether to stop the game). Enter goes to the chat box, as it does elsewhere.
- All-in run-outs have more build-up: the last card waits face down on the board for a moment, then turns over, and the result shows a beat later. In a tournament, a player knocked out by a run-out now has their cards face up the whole time (before, they flipped back face down until the result), and they stay in their seat, marked Knocked out, until the next hand, instead of vanishing the moment the result showed.

## [2026.11.05.5] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed and changed

- The bet amount box now takes only numbers (and a decimal point at tables that count in dollars and cents, or when amounts are shown in big blinds). Before, some browsers let you type letters into it.
- Phones: in Omaha and other games with four or more cards, your own cards no longer cover the players sitting either side of you at a full table. When there isn't room, your cards sit a little closer together and a little smaller. Computers are unchanged.

## [2026.11.05.4] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed and changed

- Tournaments: a player who joins a table mid-game (late registration, re-entry or a table move) and lands on the button, the small blind or between them now waits one hand for the button to pass. Before, they were dealt straight in without paying a blind that orbit.
- Table chat: John can now read any table's chat from the admin page, including after the table has closed, for example to read feedback or look into a complaint. Each time he does, the Checking John page shows it publicly, and players at that table can tell it was theirs. The Fair dealing and Privacy pages say so. Nothing changes at the tables.

## [2026.11.05.3] - 2026-11-05

_Send feedback from the table_

### New

- **Tell John what's up, right from the game.** Spotted something wrong, or have an idea? Open the table menu (the ☰ menu on a phone) and pick Send feedback. Say what happened and send it: John gets it with the table and hand number, so he can look into it. Only John reads it (and Claude, without your name, for his morning recap); for ideas you'd like everyone to see, the suggestion box on the roadmap is still there.

### Fixed and changed

- New at every table: Send feedback (in the table menu, or the ☰ menu on a phone). Tell John something is wrong, or share an idea, without leaving the game. Only John reads it (and Claude, without your name, for his morning recap).
- Behind the scenes: small changes that can't affect a game, like wording, layout and help pages, can now go live as soon as they're ready. Anything that touches the game itself is still played through on a test copy of the site first. Nothing changes at the tables.
- Behind the scenes: the morning after a night with games, John now gets a short recap of anything that went wrong (site errors, restarts, a tournament starting late). It holds no chat or names. The server keeps its error messages for 30 days for this. The Privacy page says exactly what the recap holds.

## [2026.11.05.2] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed and changed

- Tournaments: once a tournament is over, its host and players can download what was said at every table, including tables that broke during play, with "Download table chat" in the lobby's Tables tab. Before, table chat was kept but couldn't be read once the tables closed.

## [2026.11.05] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed and changed

- New tournament: the blind levels now say plainly when they're the RSDP levels (28 levels of 8 minutes, no antes), and the RSDP button at the top shows as picked. The tool for swapping in other levels has moved under "Use different blind levels", so the form no longer looks set to Regular blinds with antes. Your games stay your choice, mixed games included.

## [2026.11.02] - 2026-11-02

### Fixed and changed

- If a series' next event couldn't be made, fixing the levels now tries again too, not only fixing the other settings.
- The payout editor now says when a payout range starts above max entrants, and whether re-entries can ever reach it.
- Rebuys and add-ons are now capped at 100 per player. Events saved with more keep their number until the host changes it.
- Hand replays no longer show a robot next to a person whose account id happens to start with "bot-". Only real practice bots get one.
- If you sit at a table from two devices at once, the fair-dealing warning about a seed you didn't send now says that's expected and harmless, and when to take it seriously.

## [2026.11.01.9] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed and changed

- If the next event in a repeating series or Sit & Go can't be made, its lobby now still says why after a server restart, and the server tries again as soon as the host fixes the settings.
- Tournament settings now drop stray extra fields instead of saving them, and refuse prize amounts over $100,000 and payout tables that run past 10,000 entries.
- Fixed a rare mix-up where a player could be taken for a practice bot, leaving their real games off the leaderboard and their profile.
- Behind the scenes: the automatic browser test now stops its practice table when it finishes. Nothing changes at the tables.

## [2026.11.01.8] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed and changed

- In the tournament structure editor, a typed small blind, big blind or ante now stops at the site's maximum chip amount instead of letting you enter a value that can't be saved.
- Tournament payout tables now have a size limit: up to 150 ranges, each paying up to 200 places. A tournament whose settings would be too big to save as a structure is now refused when you make it, not later when you try to save it. If an existing repeating series or Sit & Go has a payout table over the limit, its lobby now says why its next event couldn't be made.
- Fair dealing: the "Download proof" file now says whose each seed is and who was dealt in, so the standalone checker script can also catch a seed listed for a practice bot, for someone who wasn't dealt in, or twice for one player.
- Hand search no longer shows a robot badge on a real player whose account id happens to look like a bot's.
- Behind the scenes: our automated tests now replay tournaments exactly and clean up after themselves. Nothing changes at the tables.

## [2026.11.01.7] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed and changed

- Cash games: the betting buttons now stay locked until your move is answered or the turn moves on, so a chat message or someone sitting down can no longer unlock them early and let a second tap through.
- Cash games: if the host sets the stack of a player who ran out of chips, that player is now dealt back in, just as after a rebuy, instead of staying stuck as out of chips.
- Fair dealing: your browser now warns about extra seeds no one else would check (more than one under your name, one under a practice bot or someone not dealt in, or the same seed twice), and "Check this hand" and the proof checker catch them too.
- Tournament structures: "+ Add level" now stops at the most the site allows (100 levels), and new levels' blinds and ante stop at the maximum chip amount.
- Saving a tournament structure or table preset without signing in now applies the same size and count limits as an account, so what you save can be brought over when you sign in.
- Behind the scenes: our automated tests now deal more varied hands and fail less often on a busy machine. Nothing changes at the tables.

## [2026.11.01.6] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed and changed

- Fixed a security problem.

## [2026.11.01.5] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed and changed

- Cash games: if the server crashed just as a hand ended, that hand could come back unfinished and be played again after the restart; it now stays finished with the result it had.
- Cash games: a run-it-twice vote that arrives very late on a slow connection no longer counts toward the next hand's vote.
- At a table, Sit out, I'm back, straddle and wait for the big blind now show a message if the server says no or the connection drops, and I'm back no longer shows when you have no chips to sit back in with.
- If you're sitting at a table, waiting for a seat, or entered in a tournament as a guest, signing in to an account you made on another device now asks you to leave first and links you to that table or tournament, instead of quietly leaving your seat or entry behind.
- Stud and Razz: if the player who must bring in is all in from the ante, the next player no longer has a bring-in posted for them when they are away or out of time (they fold instead), and practice bots that open in that spot explain it correctly.
- Tournaments: when a tournament ends, its last table just shows the winner, with no countdown to a next hand that never comes.
- How to play: the time bank and rabbit hunt guides now explain that tournaments set their own clock, time bank and rabbit hunting, and at a table the time bank example uses that table's own numbers.
- “Download full log” now includes every chat message and table event since the table started, not just the most recent ones. For tables played before this update, it has whatever had not already dropped off.
- Table settings: “Add game” and “Add level” now stop at the most the site allows (20 games, 100 levels), and new blind levels stop at the maximum chip amount.
- Saved table setups and tournament structures count each emoji in the name as two characters, the same as the name box, so a long name gets a clear “names can be up to 60 characters” message instead of a confusing “Invalid preset” error.
- Signing in with many large setups saved in your browser no longer drops the connection: they come over to your account in smaller steps.
- The Roadmap page is up to date again.
- Behind the scenes: more automatic tests, including the betting bar, a nightly run of the long game simulations, and a rehearsal of each release's upgrade on saved data.

## [2026.11.01.4] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed and changed

- The site's own code is now open source under the MIT license, so anyone may use, copy or change it. The Credits page says so.
- At the table: if your connection is slow and you tap again, a tap that reaches the table after its turn is over is now refused instead of being played on the next street.
- If something breaks on a page, you now see a short “Something broke” note with a Reload button instead of a blank screen. At a table, only the chat or the side panel goes if that is what broke. The page also sends the server a short note of what broke for its log, without your IP address or who you are (see the privacy page).
- Behind the scenes: updated the libraries that store the site's data and check settings and account details, fixing two published security warnings. The same settings are accepted and refused as before. New automatic checks help catch a database update being skipped or losing saved data before it goes live.

## [2026.11.01.3] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed and changed

- Checking John and Fair dealing: the pages now say plainly that GitHub's checks run right after each release GitHub deploys and otherwise every few hours, not every hour as they claimed (GitHub starts its scheduled jobs hours late). Checking John no longer wrongly says the checks have stopped whenever the last one is over three hours old. The privacy page now says the backup runs once a day, not every night.

## [2026.11.01.2] - 2026-11-01

_Tournament clock rules on show_

### New

- **See the clock before you sit down.** A tournament's page now shows its table rules: the heading says how long you get to act, and the Structure tab spells out the time bank, rabbit hunting and straddles (always off in tournaments). A host can also change these rules from the Host tab until the first table opens, so a repeating tournament set up before the RSDP rules arrived can switch to them with one button. Later events in that series keep the new rules. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- Tournaments: a host can change the clock, time bank and rabbit hunting from the lobby's Host tab until the first table opens. Before, an event made before the RSDP table rules (31 Oct) was stuck on a 30-second clock with rabbit hunting, and so was every later event in its series.
- Tournaments: copying an event made before 31 Oct, or loading a setup saved before then, now fills in the RSDP table rules instead of the old 30-second clock with rabbit hunting.
- Tournaments: the lobby shows the table rules to everyone.
- Everywhere: if your connection drops just after you press a button (a phone losing signal, or the server restarting for an update), the button no longer stays busy until you reload. You get a message to check whether it went through and try again. A button pressed while you're already offline still waits until the connection is back.
- The Changelog page shows each release's version number. It matches the release of the same name on GitHub, whose notes also list the bug reports and requests that release closed.
- Every release is now checked on the live site automatically after it goes out, and the code's outside building blocks are pinned and kept up to date.

## [2026.11.01] - 2026-11-01

### Fixed and changed

- Tournaments: a busted player who lets a rebuy offer run out (or declines it) now places by when they busted. Before, anyone who busted while they were deciding placed below them, and players busted in the same hand were no longer ordered by their starting stacks.
- Cash games: stopping the game opens every hand so far for checking once it has stayed stopped for half an hour. A host who stops and starts again sooner no longer shows everyone the earlier folded hands.

## 2026-10-31 (d)

_Review your hands, but no HUDs at the table_

### New

- **Hand downloads wait until you're done.** While the game is running and you're in a seat, the hand downloads are switched off, so nobody can run a HUD while playing. That covers the PokerTracker/Holdem Manager file, the text and JSON files and the full log. They come back as soon as you leave your seat or the host stops the game. Replays, the Hands tab, the Stats tab and the ledger CSV work the whole time, and practice tables against bots aren't affected. The Fairness page explains what this can and can't stop. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- Stud: the low card must bring in and can no longer fold instead. If they leave the table on that turn, the bring-in is posted for them and the next player faces it.
- Stud: a bring-in as big as the small bet (as in a 1/2 game) now counts as the opening bet, so third street can be raised. Before, the Raise button only offered to match it.
- No-limit and pot-limit: short all-ins that together make a full raise now let players who already acted raise again, as the usual tournament rules say.
- Limit: a betting round capped with three or more players stays capped when a fold leaves two.
- Tournaments: with re-entry open to the end, the last player left no longer waits forever. The event ends a minute after the last bust unless someone re-enters (or asks the host to).
- Tournaments: levels or a break added while the last level was running over now play in order, instead of being skipped.
- Tournaments: a bounty won by a player who had asked to leave during that hand is now paid to them instead of vanishing.
- Shared hand links made with Show my cards now show the sharer's cards, older links included.
- The tracker download (OHH) labels small and big blinds properly again, so PokerTracker and Holdem Manager read the blinds right.
- The leaderboard's This month and This year start at midnight where you are, not at midnight in London, so a late game on the last night of the month counts in that month.
- To keep spam out, one player or address can make up to 20 tables and 10 tournaments every 10 minutes, and keep up to 10 tournaments open at once.
- The Fairness page has a new section on HUDs and tracking software: what the site does about them, and what it can't stop.

## 2026-10-31 (c)

### Fixed and changed

- After a seat shuffle or move between hands, the player now in a seat could see the folded cards of whoever sat there in the hand just played. Everyone now sees only their own cards from that hand.
- When the server restarted mid-hand (an update or a crash), at a cash or tournament table, the player to act was folded straight away when the table came back, and a run it twice vote counted as No. Their clock now starts again in full.
- Removing a player during the run it twice vote no longer folds a hand they had already called.
- Changing the table size no longer moves the button and blinds to a random seat.
- Fixed limit: the big blind now counts as the first bet toward the cap (it allowed one raise too many before the flop and the first draw), and an all-in for less than half a bet no longer uses up the cap.
- Stud: the bring-in can no longer be skipped by calling nothing.
- A double tap on Check or Call no longer also plays your next turn.
- Tournaments: re-entries beyond the event's max players no longer wipe out the payouts, and with lots of re-entries in a small field no prize goes unpaid (the lobby's payouts list now matches).
- Tournaments: a rebuy asked for in time now waits for the host's approval instead of the player being knocked out.
- Tournaments: hand-for-hand no longer freezes at two-seat tables, and a table whose busted player is deciding on a rebuy holds the round like any other.
- Tournaments: a player moved to another table keeps what's left of their time bank.
- Tournament results count a re-entered player's earlier rebuys and add-ons.
- Tournament form: unticking Add-ons removes the break it added, and the payout table no longer shows a false error after changing Max players.
- Half an emoji in table chat (or a table name) could stop the table from being saved. It's now cleaned up.
- In rare timing (a tab closed, or moved on to another table, just as its table was loading), the player was left shown as online there. Fixed.
- Table chat is limited to 8 lines per 10 seconds per player.
- Wrong passwords when unlinking Google are now limited, like sign-in.
- Settle up no longer says the books are off at a table with a house fee; it says what the fee took.
- Stop game now warns that stopping lets everyone check every hand so far, folded cards included, and points to Pause for a break.

## 2026-10-31 (b)

_Tournament table rules_

### New

- **Our tournament clock.** A tournament now has its own table rules: the decision clock, the time bank and how often it refills, and whether rabbit hunting is allowed. New tournaments start the RSDP way: 10 seconds to act, a 20-second time bank that refills every 30 hands, and no rabbit hunting. Change them under At the tables when you make one. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- Tournaments have their own table rules (decision clock, time bank, rabbit hunting). New ones use the RSDP rules: 10-second clock, 20-second time bank refilled every 30 hands, no rabbit hunting. Before, tournament tables always had a 30-second clock, a 30-second time bank refilled every 10 hands, and rabbit hunting. Straddles stay off in tournaments, as before.

## 2026-10-31

_Our own tournament structure_

### New

- **Blinds the RSDP way.** A new tournament now starts on the group's own structure from PokerNow: 63,000 chips, 28 levels of 8 minutes from 100/200 up to 60,000/120,000, no antes and no breaks, with late registration through level 5. It's also the RSDP button under Start from, next to Turbo, Standard and Deep stack. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- New tournaments start on the group's RSDP structure (63,000 chips, 28 eight-minute levels, no antes, late registration through level 5), also offered as the RSDP starter.

## 2026-10-30 (c)

### Fixed and changed

- New tournaments show a prize pool and payouts by default ($20 buy-in, our payout table), so every tournament's buy-ins and prizes are kept with its results. Untick it for a freeroll.

## 2026-10-30 (b)

_Our own tournament payouts_

### New

- **Prizes split the RSDP way.** When you show a prize pool, a new tournament now starts with the group's own payout table from our results sheet: winner takes all up to 5 players, then one more place paid for every 5 more players, in $5 steps. At a $20 buy-in it pays exactly what the sheet does (6 players: $85 / $35, 8 players: $105 / $55). The other presets are still in the list. (Suggested by John.)

### Fixed and changed

- Tournament payouts default to the group's own RSDP payout table (rounded to $5) instead of a generic curve.

## 2026-10-30 (a)

### Fixed and changed

- No more lag during a run it twice vote: if the all-in was called with under 12 seconds left on the clock, the server got stuck re-sending the table until the vote ended, which could freeze the table (and slow others) for a few seconds.

## 2026-10-29 (f)

_A calmer, cleaner table_

### New

- **Seats stay put.** Players no longer shift round the table when your turn comes or a new hand starts. It was most noticeable on phones. (Suggested by Alon.)
- **Fewer lines on the felt.** No printed betting line, a simpler crest in the middle, and empty seats without dashed outlines. (Suggested by Alon.)
- **Chips that sound like chips.** Bets, raises and pots now make the short, dry clack of clay chips settling, instead of little rings. (Suggested by Alon.)
- **A smoother turn clock.** The clock is a thin line along the bottom of the acting player's name that glides down, red for the last few seconds.

### Fixed and changed

- Seats no longer shift round the table when your turn comes or a new hand starts, mostly noticeable on phones.
- The turn clock is a calm line along the bottom of the acting player's name that glides down, instead of a ring round it that moved in little jumps.
- A cleaner felt: no printed betting line, a simpler crest, and empty seats without dashed outlines.
- Chips sound like clay chips: short dry clacks that settle, instead of little rings.

## 2026-10-29 (e)

### Fixed and changed

- The bet slider is calmer: it stops on round amounts (quarters on small bets at .25/.50, whole dollars once the stack is deep, never 18.61) instead of moving a cent at a time, and the pot buttons round to the small blind. You can still type any amount in the box.
- Roomier table: on computers the felt is a little smaller with bigger seats and cards round it, and a bit more space round the action bar. On phones your own cards are a little bigger and players at a part-empty table spread round it instead of bunching on one side.

## 2026-10-29 (d)

### Fixed and changed

- New Credits page (link at the bottom of every page and on About): the free, open-source software the site is built on, what each piece does, and every package with its license. The license texts in full are at /third-party-licenses.txt.

## 2026-10-29 (c)

### Fixed and changed

- All-in runouts take their time: when you run it twice each card comes about 3.5 seconds apart (as on PokerNow), and a normal all-in runout 2 seconds apart. Before it was 1.3 seconds, so a turn all-in run twice showed both rivers almost at once.

## 2026-10-29 (b)

### Fixed and changed

- The turn clock round the acting player's name now runs down clockwise, like a clock hand.

## 2026-10-29 (a)

### Fixed and changed

- The Fair dealing page now opens with a plain box on what you're trusting John with, what other players can and can't do, and what the public record shows.
- New Terms of use page (link at the bottom of every page): the site is free and comes as it is, with no warranty, and John isn't liable for outages, lost records, bugs or break-ins.

## 2026-10-27 (f)

_Cash games in dollars and cents_

### New

- **Play .25/.50, or any stakes you like.** Every cash game is now played for dollars and cents. Type the blinds as money on the home page (it starts at 0.25/0.50), and stacks, bets, the pot, buy-ins, the ledger and the log all show dollars. Tournaments still use chips. (Suggested by John.)
- **Casino chips.** The chips on the felt are a casino's: pennies, nickels and quarters, then white $1, red $5, green $25, black $100 and up.
- **Your presets come along.** A preset or saved setup from before counts each old chip as a dollar, so a 1/2 game is still 1/2. Tables and records from before stay exactly as they were.

### Fixed and changed

- Log lines and buy-in messages at cash tables show dollars ("sat down with 50.25"), and a shared table link's preview shows the blinds as 0.25/0.50.

## 2026-10-27 (e)

### Fixed and changed

- The Privacy page now also says who is responsible for your data, why each thing is kept, that data is stored in the USA, your rights (see, correct, delete, object, complain), what can't be deleted and why, and how Google sign-in data is used.

## 2026-10-27 (d)

### Fixed and changed

- New Privacy page (link at the bottom of every page): what the site keeps about you, who can see it, how long it stays and how to delete it.
- Deleting your account now also removes any hand links you shared. Before, they kept working and you could no longer remove them.

## 2026-10-27 (c)

_Tidy up your practice games_

### New

- **Delete practice games.** Practice games on your profile now have a Delete button, and there's Delete all. A table you made that only you and your bots played at is erased for good. Any other practice table only leaves your profile, so their record stays. Real games can still only be hidden. The public record keeps each hand's fingerprint (no cards, no names) and notes that a practice table was deleted. (Suggested by John.)
- **A practice graph you can reset.** Your profile has a second graph, Practice vs bots, showing how you're doing against the bots. Tap Reset to start it again from zero, say when you move up a bot level. Your games stay in your list. Practice still never counts on your real graph or the leaderboard. (Suggested by John.)

## 2026-10-27 (b)

### Fixed and changed

- A page left open when a new version goes live now reloads itself into it: at a table once your hand (and any all-in runout) is over, anywhere else when you switch away or move to another page. Before, an old tab kept running the old version, so fixes like the street-at-a-time runout didn't reach it.

## 2026-10-27 (a)

### Fixed and changed

- Tournament setup now lowers seats per table as soon as you pick a game that can't deal to that many (8 for stud games, 6 for Triple Draw and Badugi) and says why, instead of refusing when you press Create.

## 2026-10-26 (m)

### Fixed and changed

- The "Seconds to act" box is gone from the home page. New cash tables start with a 30 second turn clock, and the host can change it (or turn it off with 0) in Table settings under Clock.

## 2026-10-26 (l)

### Fixed and changed

- The "Play money only. Every game and option is free." line is gone from the bottom of the home page and info pages.

## 2026-10-26 (k)

### Fixed and changed

- The pot number no longer flickers backwards for a moment when a bet goes in, and the pot keeps pace with the chips instead of lagging behind. Stacks had the same tiny flicker when chips went out.
- The chip pile in the pot grows when the swept bets land on it, rather than jumping as they leave the seats.

## 2026-10-26 (j)

_Coach tips for practice_

### New

- **Tap Tip on your turn.** In a hand where everyone else is a bot, tap Tip (or press T) on your turn for a rough guide, like "About 35% to win, the call costs 25%: call". In draw games it says which cards to throw, and in 8 or better games it gives your share of the pot. It only uses what you can see: your cards, the up cards and the board, the betting and how many cards each player drew. Tap Why? for the maths. Tips never show when another person is in the hand, or at a table where people have played each other, or in tournaments.
- **Bots say why.** After each hand, the Hands tab and the replayer show why each bot did what it did, like "Ace called: it guessed about 40% to win, and the call cost 25%". Bots guess quickly, so their numbers are rough, and they never name cards. Only you see them, and only for hands where you were the only person.

## 2026-10-26 (i)

### Fixed and changed

- Behind the scenes: the site is now backed up every night to GitHub, locked with a key only John holds, and each copy is test-restored before it's kept. A check every few minutes tells John if the site goes down. Each nightly backup shows on /transparency.

## 2026-10-26 (h)

_Checking John_

### New

- **A public record of every hand and buy-in.** Every hand, every buy-in and cash-out, every admin action and every server restart now goes into a public record where each entry is locked to the one before it, and GitHub keeps a copy every hour. Editing something after the fact now shows: Check this hand and the ledger both check themselves against the record, and your browser warns you if the record changed since you last saw it. (Suggested by John.)
- **Proof of which code the site runs.** GitHub now builds and signs every release from the public code, and checks every hour that the live site runs exactly that build. The new Checking John page (linked at the bottom of the site) shows what it found, every admin action, and what these checks still can't catch.

### Fixed and changed

- The site footer shows which build the server says it runs, linked to that code on GitHub.
- The felt colour buttons under Look and sound are full size again, with their names inside, and the colour you just picked keeps its gold border.
- On phones, the choices under Look and sound (big blinds, two or four colours, gestures) sit on one line each instead of wrapping.
- The leaderboard's colour key is back to small squares.

## 2026-10-26 (g)

_A table with some spark_

### New

- **A lit table.** A lamp over the felt, a cloth you can almost feel, a padded rail and real shadows under the cards and chips. Whoever is acting sits in a pool of light.
- **Cards and chips that move.** Cards are thrown from the dealer button, board cards turn over one by one with a snap, bets are tossed in, and stacks count up when you win. Your shot clock runs round your nameplate.
- **Big moments.** The winning five cards lift and glow, the result is a gold banner, and an all-in player goes red-hot while the cards run out.
- **Our own look.** An RSDP crest in the felt, our own card back, and bigger, clearer numbers for stacks, bets and the pot. Too much movement on a slow phone? Turn off Table motion under Look, sound and me.

### Fixed and changed

- Turning off Table motion (under Look, sound and me) stills the whole table, the older card and chip movement included, just like your device's reduce-motion setting.

## 2026-10-26 (f)

_Bot levels, better pre-moves and side games explained_

### New

- **Pick how good your practice bot is.** Choose Easy, Normal or Hard when you add a bot or start a practice game, and change it any time from the bot's popup. Easy calls a lot, bets small and never bluffs, which makes it good for learning a new game. Hard reads what your bets mean, learns how you play, uses position and bluffs. In our heads-up test matches, Hard beat Normal and Normal beat Easy in every game.
- **Pre-click your move, and change your mind.** Before your turn, tap Check / Fold, Check, Call or Call any and it plays the moment your turn comes. Tap it again to cancel. If someone bets first, Check / Fold turns into Fold, and a Check or a Call of an amount that has since been raised clears itself so you decide again. On a computer the keys work too: F, K, C and A tick a pre-move, and pressing the key again unticks it. (Suggested by John.)
- **How to play now covers the side games.** The How to play guides now explain the Nit game, the 7-2 bounty, bomb pots, double board, run it twice, straddles, rabbit hunting, the time bank, showing and mucking, the house fee and missed blinds. Each one says how it works here, walks through an example, and lists any host settings that change it. At a table, How to play shows the ones switched on there first, and the Nit game's ? button links to its full guide.
- **Your browser watches for a swapped deck.** Each hand's deck is sealed before the deal. Your browser now also warns you if the table swaps the sealed deck for the next hand for a different one without dealing it, which is one way a dishonest server could hunt for a deck it likes. The Fairness page explains how it works and what it can't catch.

### Fixed and changed

- A ticked Check / Fold no longer vanishes from view when someone bets: it shows as Fold, and you can untick it.
- In draw games, the hand log now says "stands pat (auto)" when someone stood pat because they were away or ran out of time, so it doesn't look like a choice.

## 2026-10-26 (e)

_No secret spectators_

### New

- **You're always told when spectators can see your cards.** If a host lets spectators see every hole card, everyone at the table now gets a warning in chat and on screen. While it's on, the table's rail turns red and a line says how far behind spectators watch and how many are watching. You have to agree to it before you sit down, it can only be turned on between hands, and every other settings change is now announced in the table log.

### Fixed and changed

- Turning off spectators seeing every card now works straight away, even in the middle of a hand, and spectators with a delay don't get to watch the rest of that hand face up.
- A hand dealt before spectators could see every card stays hidden from them, mucked cards included.

_Saved tournament setups, a clearer Nit game and a changelog_

### New

- **Save your favourite tournament setups.** Save a tournament's setup under a name and load it in one tap when you make a new one. You can also save one from the lobby's Host tab, and rename or delete them any time.
- **Turbo, Standard and Deep stack starters.** Three ready-made setups that fill in the starting stack, blind levels and late registration for you.
- **Presets follow your account.** When you're signed in, your saved tournament setups and cash table presets come with you to every device. Guests keep them in their browser.
- **The Nit game explains itself.** The Nit game box under the action bar now says where the round stands: how many more players it needs, or whether you're on the nit. A ? button explains the rules, and the NIT tag on a seat shows in purple.
- **A changelog for the small stuff.** Small fixes now have their own Changelog page, linked at the bottom of the site, so What's new stays about new features and changes you'll notice.

### Fixed and changed

- When the host pauses during a hand, the turn clock now stands still on every screen. It already did behind the scenes, so nobody was ever folded for it.
- A turn paused with under five seconds left gets five seconds when play resumes.

_Slower all-in runouts, an About page and a few tidy-ups_

### New

- **All-in runouts with some drama.** When players are all in, the board now comes out a street at a time, run 1 before run 2, with a short pause before the winner is shown. Chips going into the pot now slide over the cards and land on the pot.
- **About page.** A short page for friends who are new here: what the site is, what's free (everything) and where to start. It's linked from the menu at the top, the footer and the home page.
- **Practice stays practice.** Games with a bot, or that nobody else played, now sit in their own folded Practice games list on your profile and never count toward your results.
- **Graphs up front.** Your profit graph is now at the top of your profile. The Leaderboard now has a chart of running profit over the period for up to three people: the top three to start, or tick the ones you want to compare.
- **A heads-up on unusual games.** When you pick an unusual pairing, like No Limit Seven Card Stud, while starting a table or in table settings, a note says so and offers a one-tap switch to the usual betting. It never stops you: press Keep it to carry on.
- **A smaller straddle switch.** On a computer, Straddle and Wait for the big blind are now small chips under the action bar instead of a whole row of words.

### Fixed and changed

- The extra Play link is gone from the top menu. The logo already takes you home.
- Your profile's cash games list shows whether anyone is at each table right now.
- Quiet tables are put away after 45 minutes to keep the server quick, and open again exactly as you left them.
- The pressed Straddle chip stays green when you hover over it, and screen readers read the chips properly.
- Each person keeps the same line colour on the leaderboard chart.

## 2026-10-26 (b)

_Chat, leaderboards and your profit graph_

### New

- **Table chat you can't miss.** Chat now has its own box under the log, with one-tap replies like gg and nh. On a phone, tap the chat button at the top (it shows how many messages you've missed). New messages pop up beside the player's seat for a few seconds, and Enter jumps to the chat box.
- **Bet in big blinds.** With the Chips | BB switch on BB, you can type and bet in big blinds too. Type 3 to raise to three big blinds.
- **A steadier table.** The table keeps one size through a hand, empty seats keep clear of players, and the pot shows as one line. People, How to play, shortcuts and Look and sound now live in one Menu at the top of the table, and runs of "sat down" lines in the log fold into one.
- **Leaderboard.** See who's up this month, this year or all time on the new Leaderboard page, ranked by profit, hands played or biggest pot. Only real cash games count: practice tables with bots and tournaments are left out. Anyone with the link can see it.
- **Your profit graph.** Your profile now draws your results game by game, so you can see how your nights add up.
- **Search your hands.** Find hands you played by your cards (like AA or AKs), who you played with, the game, pot size or how it went, then replay or share them.
- **Tidy up your records.** Hide a cash table from your profile (it stays for everyone else), and hosts can delete a test table nobody really played at.
- **A cleaner front page.** A menu across the top of every page outside the tables, two big choices on the home page (start a cash game or host a tournament), tidier tournament lobby and setup screens, and simpler sign-in pages. Your profile now opens with your totals.

### Fixed and changed

- Tournament tables no longer show up in your list of cash games, on your profit graph or on the leaderboard.
- The table keeps one size through a hand instead of shrinking and growing.

_A slicker table, co-hosts and optional accounts_

### New

- **A slicker table.** Bigger cards tucked into each player's nameplate, a clean middle with the pot above the board, and bets that sit just outside each seat. The table fills your window, so Stud fits on a laptop screen without scrolling.
- **Fuller sounds.** New, richer sounds for cards, chips and checks, and a softer marimba to tell you it's your turn.
- **Real chip colours.** Chip stacks use casino colours that scale with the blinds, so you can read a bet at a glance.
- **Play from the keyboard.** F folds, K checks and C calls, and R gets a raise ready. Each button shows its key, and "?" lists every shortcut.
- **Chips or big blinds.** Flip the Chips | BB switch at the top of the table (or press B) to see every stack and bet in big blinds.
- **Bots with names.** Each practice bot gets its own short name and robot picture, like Ace, Lucky or Ducky.
- **Co-hosts for cash tables.** Open the People list (the 👁 button, or ☰ then People on a phone) and make a friend a co-host. They can approve seats and run the game while you play.
- **Sign in on any device.** Create an account with a username and password, then sign in on your phone, laptop or tablet to play as yourself with the same name, picture and notes. Guests can still play without signing up.
- **Your history comes along.** When you create an account, everything you've played on that device stays yours. Sign in on another device and what you did there as a guest moves into your account too.
- **Your profile.** A new profile page shows your cash games with your result at each table, and your tournament finishes. Change your name, picture or password there, sign out, or delete your account.
- **Sign in with Google.** Skip the password: continue with your Google account, or link it to the account you already have from your profile.
- **Forgot your password?.** There's no email, so ask the site admin for a one-time reset code and enter it on the Forgot password page.

### Fixed and changed

- Your mood emoji stays with you when a tournament moves you to a new table.
- A hand shown after it ends now appears in the replayer.
- Bots keep their robot picture in replays, and no two bots share a name.
- Setting a new password signs you out on every other device.

_Practice bots, a new look and fair dealing you can check_

### New

- **Practice bots.** Add a bot to any empty seat of a cash table and practice any game for free, including Stud, Razz, Triple Draw and Badugi. A player's bot needs the host's OK, like any seat.
- **A new look.** A clean, flat felt with new cards, seats with pictures, chips and buttons. On phones the seats spread out evenly and run-it-twice boards stay clear of them.
- **Fair dealing you can check.** Every deck is sealed before the deal and mixed with a random seed from each player's browser. Press "Check this hand" in the replayer to verify any hand, and read how it works on the Fairness page.
- **Roadmap and suggestions.** See what's coming next on the Roadmap page, send your own ideas, and follow what happens to them in the suggestion log.
- **Clearer game names.** Shorter game names, and hi-lo games are labelled 8 or better.

### Fixed and changed

- Fixes for players leaving while all in, tables shrinking and phones dropping out.
- The action bar no longer locks up if the server's answer gets lost.
- Empty seats keep clear of players' nameplates.

## 2026-10-25 (b)

_Tournament formats, host tools and table extras_

### New

- **Find tournaments easily.** The home page lists upcoming and running tournaments. Turn on browser alerts, chat in the lobby, and links show a proper preview in WhatsApp.
- **New tournament formats.** Bounty and progressive knockout events, invite codes, check-in, and season leaderboards that add up points across nights.
- **Tournament host tools.** Co-hosts, seat moves, custom stack approval and copying an old tournament's settings.
- **Cash game host controls.** A waitlist, seat shuffles, spectators with a delay, chat settings and saved table presets.
- **Table extras.** Avatars, emotes, stacks in big blinds, all-in odds, sounds, keep-screen-awake, and install the site on your phone like an app.
- **Better records.** Share a hand with a link, hand highlights, and full log downloads.

### Fixed and changed

- Bounty money is never lost, even when there are side pots.
- If a table delays what spectators see, the hand history is delayed too.
- Moving a player or editing a stack during a tournament no longer risks a crash.

_RSDP Poker Live! is live_

### New

- **Every game.** Hold'em, Omaha and Omaha Hi-Lo, Seven Card Stud, Stud Hi-Lo, Razz, 2-7 Triple Draw and Badugi, with a How to play guide for each one.
- **Extras for everyone, free.** Run it twice, straddles, bomb pots, the 7-2 bounty, double board, game rotation, rabbit hunting, the time bank and the Nit game.
- **Tournaments that start on their own.** Schedule one and it starts at the set time. Sit & Gos, recurring events, late registration, rebuys, add-ons and custom payouts.
- **Ledger, replayer and stats.** Settle up after the game, replay any hand, and see your stats and notes on players.

### Fixed and changed

- A tournament ends when one player has every chip.
- Names stay in the hand log after a player leaves their seat.
- The "Connection lost" banner no longer sticks on slow phones.
- Add-ons and recurring tournaments carry on after a server restart.
