# Deploying RSDP Live!

The whole site is one container: the game server plus the built web app, built from the `Dockerfile` at the repo root. On every pull request, CI builds an image from that Dockerfile and runs the browser smoke test against it. The deploy builds its own image from the same commit (see [Fly.io](#flyio-production)).

What to do when something goes wrong is in [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md).

## What the host must provide

- **Exactly one instance, always on.** Live tables and tournaments run in that one process on a server clock. A scheduled tournament has to start on time even when nobody has the site open, so turn off any "sleep when idle", "scale to zero" or auto-stop setting, and never run two copies at once.
- **WebSockets** (Socket.IO). Every mainstream host supports them.
- **Data that survives deploys.** Either:
  - set `DATABASE_URL` to a managed Postgres (14 or later), or
  - leave it unset and mount a persistent volume at `/data`. The server keeps an embedded PGlite database in `/data/pglite`.
  The container starts as root only to take ownership of `/data`, then runs the server as the unprivileged `node` user.
- **About 1 GB of memory.** With PGlite, the process peaks near 600 MB at boot, so 512 MB plans are too small. With Postgres it needs less. Coach tips run on a second thread, started by the first tip anyone asks for, which adds about 30 MB (its heap is capped at 128 MB).
- **HTTPS** in front of port `8080` (or whatever `PORT` says).

## Settings

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8080` in the image, `3001` when run locally | Port the server listens on. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | unset | Postgres connection string. When set, PGlite is not used. |
| `PGLITE_DIR` | `/data/pglite` in the image | Where the embedded database lives when `DATABASE_URL` is unset. |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` in the image | Turns off development CORS. |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | unset; `fly.toml` sets the live address | The site's public address. Link previews use it, and Google sends people back to `PUBLIC_URL` + `/auth/google/callback`. Unset, the request's own address is used. It also turns on phone alerts (push), as the contact address each alert is signed with: unset, the server sends none, so a copy and the restore drill never alert the phones in a backup. The key alerts are signed with is made on first use and kept in the database (`push_keys`), so it is in the locked backups; it is not a setting. |
| `ADMIN_KEY` | unset (a secret) | Turns on the roadmap admin page (suggestions, table feedback, reset codes, reading a table's chat with `/api/admin/chat/:id`, each read in the public record) and the backup download (`/api/admin/backup`). At least 12 characters, or the server ignores it. |
| `REPORT_KEY` | unset (a secret) | A read-only key for the game-night recap (`/api/admin/recap`, see [Game-night recap](#game-night-recap)). It opens nothing else. At least 12 characters, or the server ignores it. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset (secrets) | Sign in with Google is on only when both are set. |
| `BUILD_COMMIT` | set when the image is built | The commit the image came from. `deploy.yml` passes it as a build argument, and `/api/version` reports it. |
| `FLY_IMAGE_REF`, `FLY_MACHINE_ID` | set by Fly | Reported by `/api/version`. `FLY_IMAGE_REF` also goes in the public record each time the server starts, with the commit. |

On the live site, the plain settings live in `fly.toml` under `[env]`. The secrets are copied to Fly by `deploy.yml` from GitHub's repository secrets, on every deploy.

### GitHub secrets

| Secret | Used by | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN` | `deploy.yml`, `fly-setup.yml`, `transparency.yml` | A Fly API token for the app (see [Fly.io](#flyio-production)). The watcher also uses it as its fingerprint key (`WATCH_KEY`), so a new token changes every published secret fingerprint once. The public record then says the app's secrets changed, which is expected. |
| `ADMIN_KEY` | `deploy.yml` (copies it to Fly), `backup.yml` (downloads the daily backup), `replace-name.yml` (takes a deleted player's name out of old records, run by hand: [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#someone-asks-for-their-name-to-be-taken-out)) | The admin key above. Removing the secret turns the admin page off at the next deploy, and stops the backups too, because they need it. |
| `REPORT_KEY` | `deploy.yml` (copies it to Fly) | The read-only recap key above. The same value goes in the Claude project's cloud environment as `RSDP_REPORT_KEY`, where the scheduled recap reads it. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `deploy.yml` (copies them to Fly) | The Google sign-in client, from the Google Cloud console. |

Only workflows on `main` should use these. GitHub never shows a secret's value again, so replacing one means making a new value at its source. The steps are in [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#a-key-may-have-leaked).

### Adding a setting or secret

The transparency watcher publishes the names of the live app's secrets and a fingerprint of its settings. It opens a **public** issue for any secret not in `SECRETS`, and for any setting that `fly.toml` on main doesn't have or sets differently. So, in this order:

1. In the same pull request that starts reading it, add a new **secret** to `SECRETS` in `scripts/transparency/deploys.mjs`, or put a new **plain setting** in `fly.toml` under `[env]`. Add it to the tables above.
2. For a secret, add the step that copies it to Fly in `deploy.yml`. Set it with `flyctl secrets set`, as the admin key step does, not with `secrets import`, which cuts a value off at the first `#`. (The Google step still uses `secrets import`. That's safe only because Google's values never contain a `#`.)
3. Merge and release. Only then add the GitHub secret (John), and run Deploy once.

Never set a secret on Fly by hand. The watcher can't tell who set it.

The schema migrates itself at startup. Concurrent starts are serialised with an advisory lock.

- **Health check:** `GET /api/health` returns `{"ok":true,"tables":2,"memoryMb":376,"db":"ok","diskUsedPct":30,"diskFreeMb":650}`. `ok` and the status 200 never change while the server runs, because Fly's own health check reads them. `memoryMb` is the memory the server process uses; `db` is explained under [Site-down alert](#site-down-alert). `diskUsedPct` (how full the data disk is, as `df` shows it) and `diskFreeMb` (what the server can still write) are left out when the server can't read the disk, and when it runs on Postgres; it reads the disk at most once a minute. The [memory and disk check](#memory-and-disk-check) reads them.
- **Shutdown:** on `SIGTERM` the server stops play, saves every tournament and table, gives requests still being answered 2 seconds, then cuts any connection still open (a half-sent request, a stalled download, a websocket whose browser never answers), writes the last public record entries, and closes the database. A backup download in progress is stopped first. It logs how long each step took (`shutdown: saving tables took 40 ms`, then `shutdown: finished in 120 ms`). If it hasn't finished within 10 seconds it logs `shutdown: gave up after 10000 ms, stuck <step> ...` and exits anyway, skipping whatever was left, so give the host's stop timeout at least that long (Fly's is 30 s). CI fails a pull request whose server needs that fallback: its restart step holds a half-sent request open, stops the container with docker's limit raised to 30 s, and checks the time and the log.

## Restarts and deploys

A deploy restarts the process:
- Tables reload from their last saved state.
- A hand in progress resumes with the same cards.
- Tournaments keep their clocks, and scheduled ones still start on time.
- Players' browsers reconnect by themselves.

**Each release's upgrade is rehearsed first.** Every pull request into `main` runs "Upgrade from what is live" (`.github/workflows/upgrade.yml`) on GitHub's machines, never on the live site. It runs `main`'s image and makes data with `main`'s own smoke test, then starts the pull request's image on that same volume. The new image must give the same leaderboard and keep every entry of the public record unchanged. It must also read back every saved table, with the same hands and players, and every saved tournament: a release that can't read them would drop them at deploy, even with the leaderboard unchanged. When it is stopped, it must shut down by itself, without its 10-second fallback. Then it starts `main`'s image again on the upgraded data, as a rollback would, and checks the same things. The play-test before a release with any full change (see CONTRIBUTING.md, "Full or light") can use the scripts in `e2e/playtest/`, which play a cash game and a tournament through real browsers on a local copy (see their README).

## Backups

The live site is backed up once a day, off Fly, by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/backup.yml`). It is scheduled for 09:41 UTC (about 5 am in New York, the quietest time for games), but GitHub starts scheduled jobs hours late: the first runs started between about 15:30 and 16:30 UTC, around midday in New York.

1. It reads the site's leaderboard and newest public record entry, then downloads the whole database from `GET /api/admin/backup` (needs the `X-Admin-Key` header; one at a time, and a server shutting down stops it first, as does a download that is cut off part-way). The server reads every table in one transaction, so the copy is one moment in time; on PGlite, table saves wait for it (about a second per 25 MB). Each download goes in the public record as an admin action the moment it starts (so one stopped part-way shows too), because a copy holds any hand being played at that moment.
2. **Restore drill:** it restores the copy into a fresh PGlite folder (`apps/server/src/restore.ts`), starts a real server on it (`scripts/backup/drill.sh`), and checks that the restored server gives the same all-time leaderboard and has the site's newest public record entry with the same hash. CI runs the same drill on every pull request, after the browser smoke test.
3. It locks the copy with [age](https://age-encryption.org) to the public key in `scripts/backup/recipient.txt` and keeps it as a workflow artifact for 90 days. The repo is public and anyone signed in to GitHub can download artifacts, so the lock is what keeps the copy private. Only the matching private key opens it. John made the pair on his own computer (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f rsdp-backup-key -N ""`; age takes an SSH public key as a recipient, and `ssh-keygen` comes with macOS and Windows) and keeps the private half outside GitHub, in his password manager. It is in no secret, file or server of ours, so nothing GitHub or Fly holds can open a backup. It is a random key, not a password, so it can't be guessed. Lose it and the backups can't be opened: make a new pair, put the new public key in `recipient.txt`, and the next day's copy uses it. Locking needs no secret, so this adds nothing to Fly and the transparency watcher is unaffected.
4. A failure opens the issue "Nightly backup failed", mentioning John; the next good run closes it.

Fly's own daily volume snapshots carry on as a second copy (same company, same region).

**Format:** gzipped JSON lines: a header (format version, time, number of migrations, tables), one line per row (`row_to_json`, so jsonb, timestamps and big numbers come back exactly), and an end line with each table's row count, which is how a restore knows the copy wasn't cut short. A backup restores into a fresh database of the same or a newer schema, PGlite or Postgres. Tables a newer schema has dropped (the unused chip ledger, `chip_movements` and `seat_sessions`, which older backups list) are made again for the restore and dropped again if the backup had no rows for them (`RETIRED` in `apps/server/src/db/backup.ts`).

**Restoring:**

```bash
# 1. Download the artifact (Actions → Nightly backup → a run → Artifacts), unzip it, and unlock it with the private key
#    (the private key file, rsdp-backup-key; delete any copy you made for this afterwards):
age -d -i rsdp-backup-key -o backup.jsonl.gz rsdp-backup-….jsonl.gz.age
# 2. Test it on your own machine: restores into memory and prints the rows per table.
npx tsx apps/server/src/restore.ts backup.jsonl.gz --check
# 3. Into a new PGlite folder (or a postgres:// URL of an empty database). Nothing is written unless all of it restores.
npx tsx apps/server/src/restore.ts backup.jsonl.gz /data/pglite-restored
```

On Fly, the server does the swap itself when it starts, because swapping folders under a running server corrupts both:

1. Check there is room: `fly ssh console -C "df -h /data"`. The old data stays until you delete it, so you need about twice the database's size free.
2. Copy the unlocked backup up beside the data folder, then rename it into place (so a half-copied file is never picked up):
   `fly ssh sftp shell`, then `put backup.jsonl.gz /data/restore.jsonl.gz.part`, then `fly ssh console -C "mv /data/restore.jsonl.gz.part /data/restore.jsonl.gz"`.
3. Restart: `fly machine restart`. Before it opens the database, the server restores the file into a new folder (`apps/server/src/db/restoreOnStart.ts`) and swaps it in. It keeps the old data as `/data/pglite-before-restore-<time>` and renames the file to `restore.jsonl.gz.done-<time>`. If the backup doesn't restore, nothing changes, the file becomes `restore.jsonl.gz.failed-<time>`, and the log says why (`fly logs`).
4. Once all is well, delete the old folder and the file to free the space.

If the volume is gone, deploy first so a new one exists. Restoring takes the site back to the moment of the backup: tell players, and expect the public record on GitHub to show where the site's record went back (that is the record working as intended). Unlocking needs `age` on your computer (`brew install age` on a Mac, `winget install FiloSottile.age` on Windows).

- **Postgres:** `restore.ts` restores into an empty Postgres database too, with a role that may skip foreign key checks while loading (a superuser). With managed Postgres, also use the provider's own backups.

## Site-down alert

`.github/workflows/uptime.yml` asks `/api/health` whether the site is up and its database answers within a second. If not for about 3 minutes, and no deploy is running, it opens the issue "The site is down", mentioning John so GitHub emails him, and closes it when the site is fine again. It is scheduled every 5 minutes, but GitHub starts scheduled jobs late when it is busy: since 26 October 2026 it has run only every 3 to 7 hours. So it is a slow backstop, and an outage overnight or at a tournament's automatic start could go unnoticed for hours. GitHub also turns off scheduled workflows in a public repo after 60 days without a commit; re-enable them under Actions if that happens.

**A quick alert needs an outside monitor** in John's own name (issue #180): a free monitor such as UptimeRobot, type Keyword, URL `https://rsdp-poker-live.fly.dev/api/health`, keyword `"ok":true`, every 5 minutes, alerting John's email and phone. That keyword only tells whether the server answers. `/api/health` always answers `ok: true` with status 200 while the server runs (Fly's own health check relies on that), plus `db`: `"ok"`, `"slow"` (no answer within a second) or `"error"`. Only the GitHub check reads `db`, counting anything but `"ok"` as down; a monitor on the keyword `"db":"ok"` would catch a stuck database too, but could also alert on a single slow moment.

## Memory and disk check

The server and its embedded database share one machine with 1 GB of memory and a 1 GB data disk. Memory peaks near 600 MB at start-up, and the database's files grow between restarts: the vacuum every 5 minutes lets saves reuse space but never shrinks a file, and only the start-up `VACUUM FULL table_snapshots` gives space back. So once a day, `.github/workflows/resources.yml` reads `memoryMb` and `diskUsedPct` from `/api/health` on the live site. While memory is over 800 MB or the disk is over 70% full, it keeps one issue open, "The server is running short of memory or disk", mentioning John so GitHub emails him. It updates that issue each day the server is still over a line, and comments and closes it when both are back under.

- Read-only: it only reads `/api/health` (a failed read is retried a few times), runs from `main` only, and uses no secret but GitHub's own token. If the site doesn't answer, it does nothing (that is the [site-down alert](#site-down-alert)'s job). If the disk fields are missing, it checks memory only, and leaves an open issue open.
- The lines are `MEMORY_MB` and `DISK_PCT` at the top of the workflow. They and the issue's text are for today's machine, so a PR that changes the machine's memory or the volume's size updates them too.
- It only edits and closes an open issue with exactly that title, never another issue whose title quotes it.
- It is scheduled for 14:47 UTC, but like every scheduled job GitHub starts it hours late, which is fine for a daily check. Run it by hand from Actions → Memory and disk check → Run workflow.
- What to do when it fires is in [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#running-short-of-memory-or-disk). A bigger machine, a bigger disk or a separate Postgres database costs more each month, so that is John's call.

## Game-night recap

The morning after a night with games, a scheduled Claude task in John's project sends him a short recap: anything that could have affected a real game first, then minor things. It reads no chat (since D27 John can read table chat from the admin page, but the report key the recap uses can't), but includes what players sent with Send feedback, without names or tables (John decided this on 2026-11-05). It reads `GET /api/admin/recap` (header `X-Admin-Key` with `REPORT_KEY` or `ADMIN_KEY`; `?hours=24` by default, or `?from=&to=` as ISO times, at most 7 days). The answer is JSON (`apps/server/src/recap.ts`):

- `restarts`: each server start, and whether it followed a clean shutdown. A start with no clean shutdown in the 15 minutes before it was a crash or a machine restart.
- `errors`: the server's error lines and browser error reports, grouped by text, with counts. The server keeps these in the `ops_log` table for 30 days, at most 2,000 lines an hour.
- `activity` and `tournaments`: hands and tables by kind; each tournament that was due, started or finished in the window, with its entries and how late a scheduled one dealt.
- `feedback`: what came in with Send feedback (words, kind, game, hand number, cash or tournament, seated, phone or desktop), without the sender's name or the table, at most 200.
- `quiet`: no hands were dealt and no feedback came in, so the task sends nothing.

Reading it changes nothing and isn't an admin action in the public record. The scheduled task needs the live site on the cloud environment's network allowlist and `RSDP_REPORT_KEY` in that environment.

## Before a release: testing on a copy

There is no standing staging server (a second Fly machine would roughly double the bill). A release with any full change (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#full-or-light-how-much-checking-a-change-needs)) is tested on a **copy**: the production image, run locally by whoever prepares the release. A release of only light changes skips this; CI and the upgrade rehearsal still run on its pull request. Rules:

- **Never the live site, and never real player data.** Don't restore a real backup into a copy: it holds every player's hands. Make test data on the copy itself.
- **Production settings and code.** Run the image as it ships. If a test needs something production doesn't have (for example, a shorter wait before hands are revealed, which takes a code change), say so in the release PR, and test the real behaviour too where you can.
- **Start from the live version when the release changes the database.** That is what the live site goes through at deploy time. The upgrade rehearsal on every release pull request does this too (see [Restarts and deploys](#restarts-and-deploys)); doing it on the copy as well lets you try what the release changes on upgraded data:

  ```bash
  wait_up() { for i in $(seq 1 60); do curl -sf localhost:3001/api/health > /dev/null && return; sleep 1; done; docker logs copy; return 1; }
  git fetch origin
  git switch --detach origin/main && docker build -t rsdp-live .        # what's live now
  docker volume rm rsdp-upgrade 2>/dev/null                              # start from an empty volume
  docker run -d --name copy -p 3001:8080 -v rsdp-upgrade:/data rsdp-live && wait_up
  BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm run smoke                           # main's own smoke test makes some data
  docker stop copy && docker rm copy
  git switch --detach origin/develop && docker build -t rsdp-release .  # what the release ships
  docker run -d --name copy -p 3001:8080 -v rsdp-upgrade:/data rsdp-release && wait_up   # the upgrade
  ```

  Then check the old tables, results and leaderboard are still there, run the smoke test again (now develop's), and finish with `docker stop copy && docker rm copy`.

The commands:

```bash
docker build -t rsdp-poker .
docker volume rm rsdp-copy 2>/dev/null                         # for a fresh copy; leave this out to keep its data
docker run -d --name copy -p 3001:8080 -v rsdp-copy:/data rsdp-poker
for i in $(seq 1 60); do curl -sf localhost:3001/api/health > /dev/null && break; sleep 1; done
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm run smoke                   # cash table, practice hand, tournament
docker stop copy && docker rm copy                             # when you're done
```

Then try what the release changes, by hand in a browser or with bots placed by hand. To try phone alerts, add `-e PUBLIC_URL=https://…` (an https address; push services may refuse anything else) to `docker run`, and open the copy at `http://localhost:3001` (browsers allow push on localhost). Alerts then really go out through the browser's push service, to the browsers that turned them on on the copy, so only on a copy with test data. The release PR records it all under **How it was tested**: what was run on the copy, what passed, and any setting that was changed.

## Releasing

Work merges into `develop` as it's ready. A release is a pull request from `develop` into `main`, and merging it deploys.

- **Who decides.** John gave a standing OK on 2026-10-26: finished work may go live without asking him each time. Ask him first about anything that costs money or changes what the product is. Tell him what shipped after each release.
- **The release PR** says `Closes #n` for every issue it ships, and its changelog entry follows the rules in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#releases) (version, What's new only for features, the roadmap page). It lists the review passes, and either the copy test or, for a release of only light changes, that every change in it is light. Its head is `develop`, so anything merged there later joins it: check again just before merging a light release.
- **Timing.** A deploy restarts the server. Hands in progress resume and browsers reconnect by themselves, but players see a short pause. That pause is accepted: a release goes out as soon as it's ready, after its play-test if it holds a full change, whether or not tables are open or a tournament is running. Don't hold it for a quiet time (John, 26 October and 7 November 2026, [D34](DECISIONS.md#d34-releases-go-out-when-theyre-ready-not-at-a-quiet-time)). Changes that are ready at the same time go out together, so players see one pause, not several.
- **After the merge,** Deploy runs by itself once CI passes on `main`. It checks that the live site reports the new commit, and runs the read-only checks (pages load, closed endpoints stay closed, sign-in setup answers). Watch that run. If it goes red, see [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#a-bad-release).
- **A fix made straight on `main`** (a hotfix) must be merged back into `develop` right away, or the next release conflicts.
- **To undo a release,** revert it with a pull request into `main` and keep any database migrations. See [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md#a-bad-release).

## Outside accounts and costs

Everything runs on John's own accounts. No values here, only what each one is for.

| Account | What depends on it |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub (`jcolter11374`) | The code, CI, deploys, daily backups, the public record (`transparency` branch), issues and alerts. |
| Fly.io | The live server, its data volume and daily volume snapshots, and the image registry. Billed by usage. |
| Google Cloud | The OAuth client behind "Sign in with Google". |

Phone alerts go through each browser's own push service (Google, Apple, Mozilla or Microsoft), which needs no account and costs nothing.

Costs: Fly bills one always-on small machine and a 1 GB volume to John's account, by usage. GitHub (public repository) and Google sign-in cost nothing. Anything that adds cost needs John's OK first: a second machine, a bigger volume, a paid service, or audio and video. If John loses access to one of these accounts, the site loses what it provides, so each one should have two-factor sign-in and saved recovery codes (#180).

## Local check of the production image

```bash
docker build -t rsdp-poker .
docker run -d --name copy -p 3001:8080 -v rsdp-data:/data rsdp-poker
for i in $(seq 1 60); do curl -sf localhost:3001/api/health > /dev/null && break; sleep 1; done
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm run smoke
docker stop copy && docker rm copy
```

## Fly.io (production)

The live site is the Fly app `rsdp-poker-live`, at https://rsdp-poker-live.fly.dev. `fly.toml` holds its settings: one `shared-cpu-1x` machine with 1 GB of memory in `iad`, never auto-stopped, with a 1 GB volume `rsdp_data` mounted at `/data` and a 30 s stop timeout. Fly takes a daily snapshot of the volume and keeps it for 5 days.

- **Deploys are automatic.** Every push to `main` runs CI, and when CI passes `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` deploys that commit with `flyctl`. Because the machine has a volume, Fly stops the old copy before it starts the new one. Afterwards the workflow checks that the live site reports the commit it just deployed and runs read-only checks (the pages load, the operator-only endpoint stays closed); a failed check turns the run red. You can also run the Deploy workflow by hand from the Actions tab.
- **Setup.** The deploy uses the GitHub Actions secret `FLY_API_TOKEN`, a Fly access token. `scripts/fly-provision.sh` creates the app and the volume if they are missing, and every deploy runs it first. The Fly setup workflow runs the same script on its own, by hand only (Actions → Fly setup → Run workflow, from `main`). It never runs on pull requests, because it holds the production Fly key.
- **Keep it at one machine.** Don't run `fly scale count 2` and don't add a second volume. Two copies would each run their own tables.
- **Useful commands** (with `flyctl` signed in): `fly logs -a rsdp-poker-live`, `fly status -a rsdp-poker-live`, `fly volumes snapshots list <volume-id>`.
- **Never point test traffic at the live site.** `e2e/smoke.mjs` creates tables and a tournament with made-up players, so it refuses a `fly.dev` URL. After a release, only read-only checks (health, pages loading) run against the live site, from the Deploy workflow or as plain reads from a Claude session (D24 in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)).
- **Removing a test tournament.** From a shell on the machine (`fly ssh console -a rsdp-poker-live`), `GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/admin/tournaments` lists every event the server holds, and `POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/admin/tournaments/<id>/archive` ends it the way its host would and hides it from every list (results are kept). These endpoints answer 404 to anything that comes through Fly's proxy.
