# Notes for AI coding sessions

Claude sessions write this project's code. Each session is short-lived, so the rules that matter are kept here, in the repo, rather than in any one session's memory. People are welcome to read this too.

## Where the truth is

- **GitHub is the record.** Open work, bugs and who is waiting on whom are [issues](https://github.com/jcolter11374/rsdp-poker-live/issues). Changes are pull requests. What's live is the commit the site's `/api/version` reports, deployed by the newest green Deploy run on `main`. The newest [release](https://github.com/jcolter11374/rsdp-poker-live/releases) normally names the same commit.
- **Memory and chat notes are a cache.** Check them against GitHub before repeating them. A status report comes from the issue lists, open bugs first, and says "unverified" for anything not checked.
- **Decisions** are in [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md). Don't reopen a settled question or "fix" a deliberate simplification listed there. If one needs changing, add a new entry that replaces it.

## How work flows

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the full process. In short:

- One issue per piece of work. One branch and one pull request into `develop`, which says `Closes #n` (or `Part of #n`).
- Merge into `develop` once CI is green and a review pass is done. Post the review as a comment on the PR: what was checked, the findings, how each was resolved, and the commit reviewed. Call it "a separate review we ran ourselves", never "independent": it isn't an outside auditor.
- Releases are pull requests from `develop` into `main`. A merge into `main` deploys.
- How a release is tested and checked: [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md). What to do when something goes wrong: [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md).

## Hard rules

- **Never send test traffic to the live site** (`rsdp-poker-live.fly.dev`): no bots, test tables, test tournaments or sign-ups. Test on a local copy. Only read-only checks run against the live site, from GitHub Actions.
- **Deploy only through `deploy.yml` on `main`.** Never from a laptop or a branch: the transparency watcher opens a public issue when it finds the live machine running an image `deploy.yml` didn't build and sign. It checks after each GitHub deploy and on a schedule that GitHub runs every few hours.
- **New secrets or settings:** add a new Fly secret to `SECRETS` in `scripts/transparency/deploys.mjs`, or a new plain setting to `[env]` in `fly.toml`, in the same PR, *before* it is set on Fly. Otherwise the watcher reports, in a public issue, an unknown secret or a setting that `fly.toml` on main doesn't have. See "Adding a setting or secret" in docs/DEPLOY.md.
- **Never handle John's backup private key.** Only John holds it. Don't ask for it.
- **Production keys stay in `main`'s own workflows.** Workflows that use `FLY_API_TOKEN` or `ADMIN_KEY` run only from `main`: keep their main-only `if:` guard, and never give them a `push` or `pull_request` trigger that runs on another branch. Changing them through a normal PR into `develop` is fine.
- **Keep public pages honest.** /fairness, /transparency and /privacy must describe what the code really does. If a change affects what they say, update them in the same PR. Any new stored data, cookie or outside service needs a docs/PRIVACY.md change.
- **Keep private things out of this public repo:** players' names (unless already public), table invite links, the group's results spreadsheet, John's budget, and anything else a player or John hasn't made public.
- **Ask John before** anything that costs money, changes what the product is, or can't be undone (deleting data, removing live tournaments).

## Before a session stops

Leave nothing only in chat or memory. Open or update the issue, push the branch, and put what's left in the PR's "Left to do" section. A bug you found but didn't fix becomes a new issue. The exception is a security hole: tell John privately, and keep the record in a draft security advisory (Security → Advisories → New draft security advisory), which only he and sessions working through his account can see. If you can't create one, ask John to. Then follow [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md#someone-reports-a-security-problem).
